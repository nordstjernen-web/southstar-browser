# Southstar on Linux — build, run, package

This document records the working setup for building and packaging
Southstar on Linux. The primary supported targets are Debian /
Ubuntu, Fedora / RHEL, and openSUSE on `x86_64`. Local Linux is the
correctness gate: every commit must pass `meson compile -C builddir`
locally before pushing.

## Build dependencies

System packages required on Debian / Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config meson ninja-build cargo rustc \
        libgtk-4-dev libepoxy-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbrotli-dev libzstd-dev \
        libuchardet-dev libpsl-dev libsqlite3-dev libseccomp-dev libwebp-dev libsdl2-dev

On Fedora / RHEL:

    sudo dnf install gcc pkgconf meson ninja-build cargo rust gtk4-devel libepoxy-devel \
        openssl-devel zlib-devel brotli-devel libzstd-devel uchardet-devel libpsl-devel sqlite-devel libseccomp-devel \
        libwebp-devel SDL2-devel

On openSUSE:

    sudo zypper install gcc pkgconf meson ninja cargo rust gtk4-devel libepoxy-devel \
        libopenssl-devel zlib-devel libbrotli-devel libzstd-devel libuchardet-devel libpsl-devel sqlite3-devel libseccomp-devel \
        libwebp-devel libSDL2-devel

On Alpine (musl libc):

    sudo apk add build-base linux-headers pkgconf meson ninja cargo rust gtk4.0-dev \
        libepoxy-dev openssl-dev zlib-dev brotli-dev zstd-dev uchardet-dev libpsl-dev sqlite-dev \
        libseccomp-dev libwebp-dev sdl2-dev

The brotli and zstd packages are optional: without them the HTTP client
simply does not advertise `br` / `zstd` content encodings.

Rust 1.85 or newer is required. On Ubuntu 24.04, whose default is 1.75,
install `rustc-1.85 cargo-1.85` instead and put `/usr/lib/rust-1.85/bin`
first on `PATH`, or use [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

Alpine builds against musl rather than glibc, so the resulting binary
is not interchangeable with the glibc portable zip — run a musl build
on a musl system. Add `clang cmake git zip` if you are packaging with
the nightly scripts.

**Required** on Linux, for inline **WebM** playback (VP9/VP8 video +
Opus/Vorbis audio): the FFmpeg `libav*` development packages, version 6.0 or
newer. `meson setup` fails without them — YouTube and most modern sites serve
VP9/WebM, so the external-player fallback is not acceptable here.

    sudo apt install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev \
        libswscale-dev libswresample-dev                       # Debian / Ubuntu
    sudo dnf install ffmpeg-devel                               # Fedora / RHEL (RPM Fusion)
    sudo zypper install ffmpeg-devel                            # openSUSE (Packman)
    sudo apk add ffmpeg-dev                                     # Alpine

`ccache` is the biggest build-time win — `meson` picks it up
automatically. With ccache warm, a clean `meson setup builddir &&
meson compile -C builddir` drops from ~35 s to ~1 s. Install once
with the distro package manager.

## Develop

    meson setup builddir
    meson compile -C builddir
    ./builddir/src/gtk/southstar

`./scripts/dev.sh build` runs `meson setup` (only if needed) and
`meson compile -C builddir` in one shot.

## Package — portable zip

`./scripts/pack-linux.sh` produces a redistributable, stripped,
LTO-optimised x86_64 build:

    dist/southstar-<version>-linux-x86_64.zip       # ~1.5 MB
    dist/southstar-<version>-linux-x86_64/          # unpacked bundle

The zip contains the `southstar` binary, the application icon,
the desktop entry, `README.md`, `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`, and a
generated `INSTALL.md` listing the runtime requirements.

The in-tree browser engine — lexbor, quickjs, and the
uchardet wrapper — is statically linked. The GTK desktop stack stays
dynamic because it expects to find pixbuf loaders, IM modules, and
font/theme data on the host at runtime; fully-static GTK isn't
practical. Runtime requirements:

- glibc 2.31+ (Ubuntu 20.04 / Fedora 34 / Debian 11 era and later)
- GTK 4.6+ with gio, gobject, pango, cairo
- libepoxy (usually pulled in by GTK 4; WebGL dispatch)
- OpenSSL 3 (libssl, libcrypto) and zlib; libbrotlidec and libzstd when
  the build found them
- libuchardet
- fontconfig + a font set, harfbuzz, freetype, libstdc++
- An X11 or Wayland session

Smoke test the bundled binary headlessly without installing:

    ./dist/southstar-<version>-linux-x86_64/southstar \
        --headless --url=https://example.com --dump=text

## Package — RPM

`./scripts/pack-rpm.sh` repackages the same staged bundle as a
binary RPM. It calls `pack-linux.sh` first if the bundle is missing,
then drives `rpmbuild` against a generated spec under
`dist/rpmbuild/SPECS/`. The resulting RPM lands in `dist/`.

    sudo zypper install rpm-build       # openSUSE
    sudo dnf install rpm-build          # Fedora / RHEL
    sudo apt install rpm                # Debian / Ubuntu (ships rpmbuild)
    ./scripts/pack-rpm.sh

Output:

    dist/southstar-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm           # ~1.3 MB

The spec uses `AutoReqProv: yes` so `rpmbuild` extracts the actual
SONAME dependencies (`libgtk-4.so.1`, `libssl.so.3`,
`libuchardet.so.0`, the GLib stack, etc.) directly
from the binary's ELF dynamic section. The same RPM file therefore
installs on Fedora, RHEL, and openSUSE without per-distro tweaks —
each distro's resolver maps the SONAMEs to its own provider
packages. (Cross-installing into Debian / Ubuntu uses `alien`.)

Install layout:

    /usr/bin/southstar
    /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/southstar.svg
    /usr/share/applications/southstar.desktop
    /usr/share/doc/packages/southstar/{README.md,THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md}

Inspect, install, remove:

    rpm -qpi dist/southstar-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm   # metadata
    rpm -qpR dist/southstar-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm   # required SONAMEs
    sudo dnf install ./dist/southstar-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm
    sudo rpm -e southstar

The `%post` / `%postun` scriptlets refresh `gtk-update-icon-cache`
and `update-desktop-database` if those tools are available, so the
application picker picks up the new entry without a re-login.

## Notes

The lower-bound glibc version pinned to `libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.x)` in
auto-generated requires reflects whatever the build host ships. If
you want broader portability than the build host's libc allows,
build inside an older base container (e.g. Rocky 8) and re-run
`pack-linux.sh` + `pack-rpm.sh` from there. AppImage packaging is
future work.
