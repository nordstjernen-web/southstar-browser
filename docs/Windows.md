# Southstar on Windows — build, run, package

https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nw8t7w5z4pl

This document records the working setup for building and packaging
Southstar on Windows. The Windows CI workflow
(`.github/workflows/windows.yml`) is the authoritative spec; what
follows is the same recipe verified on a local Windows 11 box.

The Windows build uses **MSYS2 / MINGW64** with the same toolchain
the CI workflow installs. No Visual Studio, no MSVC, no vcpkg.
The rationale is identical to the macOS Homebrew path: one
package source, audited DLLs, and the resulting binary is a
single PE32+ executable that links the same GTK 4 / libcurl /
Cairo / Pango / lexbor libraries shipped to Linux users.

## One-time setup

Install MSYS2 (use `winget` if you have it):

```powershell
winget install -e --id MSYS2.MSYS2
```

Open the **MSYS2 MINGW64** shell (not the plain MSYS shell — the
window title and prompt must say `MINGW64`) and install the build
and runtime dependencies:

```sh
pacman -Sy --noconfirm --needed \
    base-devel \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-clang \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-pkgconf \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-meson \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-ccache \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk4 \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-libepoxy \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-curl \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-ca-certificates \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-uchardet \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-libpsl \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-sqlite3 \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-libwebp \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-rust \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg
```

`mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg` is **required**, not optional: meson fails on
Windows without the `libav*` libraries (version 6.0 or newer), which carry
inline WebM — VP9/VP8 video plus Opus/Vorbis audio. MSYS2's build is
GPL-configured, which is fine for a local developer build; the
redistributable packages instead link the minimal LGPL FFmpeg that
`scripts/build-ffmpeg-lgpl.sh` builds, as CI does.

This pulls in roughly 600 MB of runtime + headers. `pacman -Syu`
is intentionally avoided: pin to the packages above rather than the
rolling latest.

A few of these pull in transitively but are listed explicitly so a
fresh box gets them in one command:

- `mingw-w64-x86_64-ca-certificates` is a hard dependency of
  `mingw-w64-x86_64-curl`, so it always arrives with curl. It's
  what makes HTTPS work — `src/net.c::ns_net_resolve_ca_bundle`
  hardcodes `C:/msys64/mingw64/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` in
  the Windows fallback list. With the package installed, dev
  builds reach `https://` without any env-var fiddling.
- `mingw-w64-x86_64-uchardet` is the charset detector used by
  `ns_html_decode_body`. Per `CLAUDE.md` it's a hard dependency;
  without it `meson setup` fails the `uchardet` pkg-config check.
- `mingw-w64-x86_64-libwebp` is a hard build dependency for
  WebP. Both lossy VP8 — used by the BBC, Wikipedia thumbnails,
  and most modern CDNs — and lossless VP8L decode in-tree via
  `src/image_webp.c`; no gdk-pixbuf loader or `loaders.cache`
  registration is involved.

## Build

From the MINGW64 shell, in the checkout:

```sh
cd /c/dev/southstar
export CC="ccache clang"
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
```

The QuickJS JS engine (forked from
[quickjs-ng](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs)) and the lexbor
HTML / WHATWG-URL parser are both vendored in-tree at
`src/quickjs/` and `src/lexbor/` respectively, so the first
`meson setup` no longer touches the network for either of them. The
only remaining source subproject is Wuffs (image decoders), shipped
as a single-file release under `subprojects/wuffs/`.

Build artifacts:

- `builddir/src/gtk/southstar.exe` — the main binary (the thin GTK
  shell; ~15 MB).
- `builddir/src/southstar-renderer.exe` — the out-of-process,
  sandboxed renderer the shell spawns per tab. Ship it next to
  `southstar.exe` (the packaging scripts do).
- `builddir/src/quickjs/libqjs.a`
- `builddir/src/lexbor/liblexbor_static.a`

Running the exe directly out of `builddir` works as long as the
MSYS2 mingw64 `bin` directory is on `PATH` (it is inside the
MINGW64 shell; from PowerShell, prepend `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`).
PowerShell smoke launches should use `scripts\smoke-windows.ps1`,
which sets that DLL search path before creating the process and
suppresses Windows loader dialog boxes if a dependency is still
missing.

Smoke test:

```sh
./builddir/src/gtk/southstar.exe --print-config | head
./builddir/src/gtk/southstar.exe --headless --dump=text about:start
./builddir/src/gtk/southstar.exe https://lite.cnn.com   # opens a GTK 4 window
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\smoke-windows.ps1 about:start
```

## Package — redistributable bundle

`scripts/pack-windows.sh` produces a self-contained `dist/southstar-win64/`
folder that runs on a Windows machine with no MSYS2 install. It:

1. Copies a tiny Win32 launcher as `southstar.exe`, copies the
   real GTK shell as `app/southstar-ui.exe`, copies
   `app/southstar-renderer.exe`, and transitively resolves every
   imported DLL via `objdump -p`, pulling each one from `/mingw64/bin/`
   into `app/` (system DLLs like `KERNEL32.dll` are skipped because
   they aren't found there).
2. Copies the GTK runtime data the binary needs at startup:
   `app/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled`,
   `app/lib/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/` (loader DLLs + `loaders.cache`),
   `app/share/icons/Adwaita/`, `app/share/icons/hicolor/`,
   `app/etc/fonts/`.
3. Copies the CA bundle to `app/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` so libcurl
   can verify TLS certificates.
4. Leaves one user-facing executable at the bundle root. The launcher
   starts `app/southstar-ui.exe`; that process bootstraps
   `GTK_DATA_PREFIX`, `GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE`, `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, and
   `SSL_CERT_FILE` from `app/` on startup, so no launcher script is
   needed. Earlier bundles shipped a `southstar.cmd` wrapper for
   this; it flashed a brief console window on launch and has been
   removed. The current `southstar.exe` launcher exists to preserve
   the public executable name and to show a clear error if a user runs
   it from inside the ZIP before extracting the whole folder.

Run it from the MINGW64 shell:

```sh
./scripts/pack-windows.sh
```

The script builds (or reuses) a separate `builddir-release/`
tree configured with `--buildtype=release`, so `NDEBUG` is
defined when QuickJS and friends compile. That matters because
quickjs-ng v0.14.0 has an unconditional `assert(list_empty(&rt->gc_obj_list))`
in `JS_FreeRuntime` (`quickjs.c:2323`) that fires on any leaked
JS object at context-teardown time — which is easy to hit when
real-world JS-heavy pages (e.g., DuckDuckGo) navigate while
event handlers / in-flight `fetch()` promises still hold
JSValues. Production builds need that assertion compiled out;
debugging the actual leak is a separate task.

Typical output: 77 DLLs, ~86 MB. The bundle is portable — extract
the whole `southstar-win64` folder to another Windows box and
double-click `southstar.exe` to launch. Running the executable
directly from inside File Explorer's ZIP view is not supported;
Explorer extracts only the clicked file, and the launcher displays
an "Extract All" message instead of failing with Windows'
`0xC0000135` missing-DLL status.

The bundle is intentionally *not* code-signed. Authenticode signing
is a separate, manual step (see Phase 11 / Distribution).
`scripts/pack-windows-installer.sh` (below) wraps this bundle in a proper
`.exe` installer with shortcuts and an uninstaller.

## Package — `.exe` installer (NSIS)

`scripts/pack-windows-installer.sh` produces a single redistributable
`dist/southstar-${VERSION}-win64-setup.exe` (~21 MB,
LZMA-compressed). It runs `scripts/pack-windows.sh` first to populate
`dist/southstar-win64/`, then feeds that directory to
[NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/) via
`data/installer/southstar.nsi` (Modern UI 2).

One-time tooling install — NSIS only, the bundle deps cover the rest:

```sh
pacman -S --noconfirm --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-nsis
```

Build the installer from the MINGW64 shell:

```sh
./scripts/pack-windows-installer.sh
```

The installer is intentionally **per-user**:

- `RequestExecutionLevel user` — no UAC prompt, no Administrator
  rights. This matches `src/security.c::ns_security_refuse_root`:
  if the browser is launched with an elevated token it drops it by
  relaunching de-elevated (see below), so it never keeps running in an
  Administrator context and a Program-Files install would buy nothing.
- Default install dir: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Southstar`.
  Overridable in the wizard (Directory page) or with `/D=<path>`
  for silent installs.
- ARP entry (Add/Remove Programs) is registered under
  `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Southstar`
  — so it appears in the user's Settings → Apps list without
  needing admin rights.

### What the installer does

1. Extracts the entire `dist/southstar-win64/` tree into
   `$INSTDIR` (preserving the root `southstar.exe` plus the
   `app/` runtime directory).
2. Creates a Start Menu group `Southstar` with shortcuts to
   `southstar.exe` and the uninstaller.
3. Optional desktop shortcut (component is selected by default on
   the Components page; opt out in the wizard).
4. Writes the ARP keys: `DisplayName`, `DisplayVersion`,
   `Publisher`, `URLInfoAbout`, `DisplayIcon`, `InstallLocation`,
   `UninstallString`, `QuietUninstallString`, `EstimatedSize`,
   `NoModify`, `NoRepair`.
5. Drops a Modern UI uninstaller (`uninstall.exe`) that reverses
   every step: shortcuts, ARP keys, the entire `$INSTDIR`.

### Silent install / uninstall

NSIS Modern UI installers accept `/S` for silent mode. Useful for
testing and for unattended deployment:

```sh
# Silent install to a custom path
./dist/southstar-1.0.29-win64-setup.exe /S /D=C:\Tools\Southstar

# Silent uninstall
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Southstar\uninstall.exe" /S
```

`/D=<path>` is NSIS-special: it must be the **last** argument, no
quotes around the path, and only literal — no environment-variable
expansion. The uninstaller forks itself into `%TEMP%` so the
original `$INSTDIR` can be removed; in silent mode this returns
immediately, so script the next step with a short delay or poll
the install dir.

### Shortcuts target `southstar.exe` directly

The public exe is a launcher that starts `app/southstar-ui.exe`.
The UI exe self-bootstraps the runtime env (`GTK_DATA_PREFIX`,
`GTK_EXE_PREFIX`, `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, `GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE`,
`CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`) from its own install directory
inside `ns_win32_anchor_gtk_data` (`src/gtk/appmain.c`). Earlier bundles
shipped a `southstar.cmd` wrapper that did this in a batch
script, but launching a `.cmd` from Explorer flashes a console
window for the lifetime of the script. Removing the wrapper and
doing the env setup in C means clean GUI startup with no console.

### NSIS script — what to edit when

`data/installer/southstar.nsi` is small (~150 lines) and parameterised
by `-D` flags from `scripts/pack-windows-installer.sh`:

- `-DVERSION=…` — propagates into the installer file name, the
  `Name` directive, `VIProductVersion`, and the ARP `DisplayVersion`.
- `-DSRCDIR=…` — the directory NSIS recursively bundles. Defaults
  to the `scripts/pack-windows.sh` output. Override to test a custom tree.
- `-DOUTFILE=…` — the produced installer path. Defaults to
  `dist/southstar-${VERSION}-win64-setup.exe`.

If you change install layout, edit `Section "Southstar"` and the
matching `Section "Uninstall"` together — the uninstaller must
reverse exactly what the installer wrote. NSIS provides no
generic uninstall log; it's a hand-rolled inverse.

## Package — MSIX (Microsoft Store)

`scripts/pack-msix.sh` wraps the same `dist/southstar-win64/`
bundle into an unsigned `dist/southstar-${VERSION}-win64.msix`
using `data/msix/AppxManifest.xml.in` and tile assets rendered from
the SVG logo. The Store policy situation (an independent engine
conflicts with policy 10.2.1), the manifest decisions, identity
overrides and local sideload testing are in `scripts/pack-msix.sh`.

## CA bundle (what `app/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` is)

A **CA bundle** is a plain-text file containing the
PEM-encoded X.509 root certificates of the public Certificate
Authorities that the browser trusts to sign HTTPS server
certificates. When the browser opens `https://example.com`,
libcurl + OpenSSL verifies that the server's certificate chains
up to a root in this file; if it doesn't, the connection is
refused as untrusted. Without a trusted CA store, every HTTPS
fetch fails with `error adding trust anchors from file:
ca-bundle.crt` (or the equivalent OpenSSL error).

The file `ca-bundle.crt` we ship is the one packaged by MSYS2 as
`mingw-w64-x86_64-ca-certificates`, which itself is sourced from
the Mozilla NSS / `certdata.txt` curated root list — the same
source Firefox uses. We bundle it because:

- **Windows itself stores roots in the registry (the Windows
  Certificate Store), not as a PEM file**, and the mingw build
  of libcurl + OpenSSL we link against does not consult that
  store. Without the bundled file, libcurl has nowhere to find
  trusted anchors and refuses every HTTPS fetch.
- The mingw libcurl is compiled with a default CA path of
  `C:/msys64/mingw64/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`. That path
  only exists on a machine with MSYS2 installed; on a fresh
  user box it is missing.

`src/net.c::ns_net_resolve_ca_bundle` resolves the file at
`ns_net_init()` time, in this order:

1. `$CURL_CA_BUNDLE` env var, if set and the path exists.
2. `$SSL_CERT_FILE` env var, same condition.
3. On Windows: `<exe_dir>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`, then
   `<exe_dir>/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`, then
   `<exe_dir>/ca-bundle.crt`, then `<exe_dir>/cert.pem`. In the
   redistributable bundle, `<exe_dir>` is `app/`.

If found, the resolved path is applied to every `curl_easy`
handle via `CURLOPT_CAINFO` before `curl_easy_perform`. The
resolution is per-process and cached for the lifetime of the
process. The UI exe also exports `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` /
`SSL_CERT_FILE` for the same path in `ns_win32_anchor_gtk_data`,
but those are redundant now that the binary self-resolves; they
only matter for third-party tooling that spawns from the same env.

On Linux / macOS the env-var path applies; otherwise libcurl's
own system-default resolution wins (`/etc/ssl/certs/...` and
friends). Those distros maintain CA stores out of the box,
so we don't ship a bundled copy there.

## Known Windows-specific differences

- **No Landlock sandbox.** `src/security.c` guards the Landlock
  syscalls behind `#ifdef __linux__`; on Windows the sandbox init
  is a no-op. The intentional analogue (AppContainer / Job Object)
  is not yet implemented.
- **Drops Administrator rights.** Elevation is detected via
  `CheckTokenMembership` against the builtin Administrators SID
  (`src/security.c::ns_security_refuse_root`). Instead of the Linux
  refuse-and-exit, the Windows build relaunches itself with the desktop
  shell's medium-integrity token (`CreateProcessWithTokenW`) and lets
  the elevated instance exit, so the browsing session runs unprivileged.
  It first checks the shell token is not itself elevated, so a fully
  elevated session cannot loop. When de-elevation is not possible it
  falls back to a plain-language `MessageBox` offering to quit (default)
  or run as Administrator anyway. `NS_ALLOW_ROOT=1` bypasses all of
  this, same as Linux.
- **Self-exe path** is resolved via `GetModuleFileNameW`, so
  Ctrl+N / target=_blank / middle-click correctly re-spawn the same
  binary path (no `/proc/self/exe` equivalent needed).
- **No `fork+exec`.** Per-window OS processes use the Win32
  `CreateProcessW` path implicitly through GIO's `g_spawn_async`.
- **No D-Bus session bus.** GLib on Windows prints a `win32 session
  dbus binary not found` warning at startup when no
  `dbus-daemon.exe` is on `PATH`. We intentionally don't ship
  D-Bus — none of the browser's surface uses it on Windows; the
  warning is benign noise. `main.c` installs a
  `g_log_set_writer_func` that filters this specific message
  through `g_log_writer_default`; every other warning still
  prints.

## Troubleshooting

- *Double-clicking `southstar.exe` does nothing — no window, no
  error.* The bundled binary is a GUI-subsystem executable with the
  crash-restart watchdog enabled by default, so a child that dies during
  startup leaves no console output to read. Two things now make this
  diagnosable:
  - A diagnostic log is written to
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Southstar\southstar-debug.log` (override with
    `NS_LOG_FILE=<path>`, disable with `NS_NO_LOG_FILE=1`). GTK/GLib
    startup warnings and errors land there even with no console.
  - When the watchdog gives up after repeated child crashes — or can't
    spawn the browser at all — it pops a message box pointing at that
    log instead of exiting silently.

  The most common cause on a fresh Windows 11 box (especially a VM, an
  RDP session, or a machine with no GPU vendor driver) is GSK renderer
  initialisation. Set `NS_GSK_RENDERER=cairo` (or `gsk_renderer = cairo`
  in the config) to force the software renderer, which works without GL.
- *"The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b)"* —
  PATH is picking up a 32-bit DLL from elsewhere. Run from the
  bundle directory so Windows finds the bundled 64-bit DLLs first.
- *Running from inside the ZIP shows "Extract All"* — extract the
  whole `southstar-win64` folder first. Windows' ZIP view launches
  a temporary copy of only the clicked file, without the `app/` folder
  the browser needs.
- *Icons missing / buttons blank in the header bar* —
  `app/share/icons/Adwaita` didn't make it into the bundle. Re-run
  `scripts/pack-windows.sh`.
- *TLS errors (`SSL certificate problem`)* —
  `app/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` isn't being picked up. Re-run
  `scripts/pack-windows.sh` and keep the root `southstar.exe`
  together with its `app/` directory.
