# Southstar on Debian — packaging and distribution

This document records how Southstar is packaged as a Debian `.deb`,
and — importantly — where in the Debian ecosystem it can actually live.
The packaging sources are in the `debian/` directory at the repository
root. For the plain build-from-source instructions (any distro) see
`Linux.md`; this document is specifically about the Debian package.

## Read this first: licensing

Southstar is **dual-licensed**: each recipient may take it under
**either** the **Nordstjernen Source License v1.0 (NSL-1.0)** **or** the
**GNU General Public License version 3 or later (GPL-3.0-or-later)**, at
their option (SPDX `LicenseRef-NSL-1.0 OR GPL-3.0-or-later`; the texts are
`License.md` and `COPYING` at the repository root).

Debian `main` only accepts software whose license satisfies the [Debian
Free Software Guidelines
(DFSG)](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). NSL-1.0 on
its own does not: its **"Competing Use"** restriction and its limit of
education and research use to **non-commercial** contexts both violate
DFSG §6 ("No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor"). The GPL,
however, is DFSG-free, and a dual license needs only one DFSG-free
option: Debian distributes the package under the GPL and recipients
keep the choice. The bundled third-party code (see
`THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`) keeps its own free, GPL-3-compatible licenses.
**Southstar can therefore go into Debian `main`**, through the usual
sponsorship and FTP-master review.

There are two paths, in order of effort:

1. **A third-party APT repository (fastest, fully under our control).**
   We host signed `.deb`s and an `apt` repo; users add it and
   `apt install southstar`. No Debian FTP-master review, works on
   Debian and every Debian derivative (Ubuntu, Mint, …). This is the
   practical channel until the package is in the archive, and is
   documented below.
2. **Debian `main`.** The GPL option qualifies the package for
   `main`. It still needs a Debian Developer to sponsor and upload it, an
   ITP bug, and FTP-master review of `debian/copyright`. The `debian/`
   tree here targets `main` (`Section: web`). Once in Debian, derivatives
   such as Ubuntu pick it up through their normal syncs (into Ubuntu's
   `universe`).

> Neither `non-free` nor `contrib` is the right home. `non-free` is for
> software with no DFSG-free license option, and `contrib` for DFSG-free
> software that *depends on* something outside `main`. Southstar is
> DFSG-free under the GPL option and its build and runtime
> dependencies are in `main`.

The rest of this document covers building the `.deb` and shipping it
through paths (1) and (2).

## The `debian/` packaging tree

```
debian/
├── changelog       # version history; top entry sets the package version
├── control         # Section: web (main), build-deps, binary package
├── copyright       # DEP-5; GPL-3+ or NSL-1.0, plus bundled-engine licenses
├── rules           # dh sequencer; configures meson with ai disabled
├── source/format   # 3.0 (quilt)
└── watch           # tracks upstream GitHub tags
```

Key choices:

* **`Section: web`** — the package targets `main`, distributed under the
  GPL option of the dual license.
* **`debian/rules`** is a minimal `dh` file. Hardening is on via
  `DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=+all`; the
  meson build already enables PIE, stack protector, and FORTIFY itself.
  Its one `dh_auto_configure` override passes `-Dns-pango=disabled`
  (sbuild/pbuilder chroots have no network, so the ns-pango subproject
  cannot be cloned — text shapes through the system Pango instead) and
  `-Dwebgpu=disabled` (wgpu-native is not packaged).
* **`debian/copyright`** is DEP-5. `Files: *` declares
  `License: GPL-3+ or NSL-1.0`, with a `GPL-3+` stanza pointing at
  `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3` and an `NSL-1.0` stanza for the
  alternative. It also spells out the free licenses of the in-tree
  engines (lexbor — Apache-2.0; QuickJS — Expat; WAMR — Apache-2.0) and
  vendored single-file libraries (Wuffs — Apache-2.0; pl_mpeg — Expat).

## Build dependencies

The Debian build needs (these mirror `Linux.md`):

    sudo apt install build-essential debhelper devscripts meson ninja-build \
        pkg-config libgtk-4-dev libepoxy-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev \
        libuchardet-dev libpsl-dev libsqlite3-dev libseccomp-dev \
        libwebp-dev libavif-dev libsdl2-dev libenchant-2-dev \
        libpango1.0-dev libfontconfig-dev \
        libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev \
        libswresample-dev

The FFmpeg `libav*` packages are **not** optional here: `meson setup` fails
without them on Linux (inline WebM — VP9/VP8 video, Opus/Vorbis audio).
`libpango1.0-dev` and `libfontconfig-dev` cover the system-Pango path that
`debian/rules` selects.

`libseccomp-dev` is marked `[linux-any]` in `debian/control`; all Debian
release architectures are Linux, so it always applies. `cmake` is **not**
a build dependency: lexbor, QuickJS, and WAMR build in-tree via meson
`subdir()` and there are no CMake subprojects.

Runtime dependencies are computed automatically by `dh_shlibdeps`
(`${shlibs:Depends}`) from the linked shared libraries — nothing is
hand-listed or bundled. `mpv | ffmpeg` and `hunspell-en-us` are
`Recommends` (external media playback and spell-check dictionary).

## Build the package

From a checkout that contains the `debian/` directory:

    dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b

`-b` builds a binary-only package; drop it for a full source+binary
build. The result lands in the parent directory:

    ../southstar_<version>_<arch>.deb

Install and smoke-test it:

    sudo apt install ../southstar_*.deb
    southstar

### Clean, reproducible builds with sbuild/pbuilder

Archive-quality builds happen in a minimal chroot so build-dependency
mistakes surface immediately. With `sbuild`:

    sudo sbuild-createchroot --include=eatmydata,ccache \
        unstable /srv/chroot/unstable-amd64 http://deb.debian.org/debian
    sbuild -d unstable

or with `pbuilder`:

    sudo pbuilder create
    pdebuild

### Lint before publishing

    lintian -i -I --show-overrides ../southstar_*.changes

For `main` the package should be lintian-clean. Any `license-problem-*`
tag — on Southstar's own sources or on a **bundled** engine — is a
real issue to fix before upload.

## Path 1 — host a third-party APT repository

This is the route that gets Southstar onto users' Debian/Ubuntu
machines without Debian's archive process.

1. **Build the `.deb`** as above (build once per architecture: `amd64`,
   `arm64`).

2. **Create a signed repository.** [`aptly`](https://www.aptly.info) is
   the simplest tool:

       aptly repo create -distribution=stable -component=main southstar
       aptly repo add southstar ../southstar_*.deb
       aptly publish repo -gpg-key=<KEYID> southstar

   Serve `~/.aptly/public` over HTTPS (e.g. at
   `https://apt.example.org`).

3. **Users add the repo** with a keyring (the modern, `signed-by`
   form — never `apt-key`):

       curl -fsSL https://apt.example.org/southstar.gpg \
         | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/southstar.gpg >/dev/null
       echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/southstar.gpg] \
         https://apt.example.org stable main" \
         | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/southstar.list
       sudo apt update && sudo apt install southstar

Updates ship by adding the new `.deb` to the repo and re-publishing;
`apt upgrade` then picks it up. Ship a `.deb` per release tag so
`debian/changelog`'s top version matches the upstream version.

## Path 2 — Debian `main`

With a Debian Developer willing to sponsor it:

1. **File an ITP** (Intent To Package) bug against `wnpp`:

       reportbug --email <you> wnpp

   Title it `ITP: southstar -- small, hand-written web browser` and
   give the license as `GPL-3+ or NSL-1.0` (SPDX
   `LicenseRef-NSL-1.0 OR GPL-3.0-or-later`), noting that Debian distributes
   it under the GPL-3+ option and that it targets `main`.

2. **Polish the source package.** Build cleanly in `sbuild`, get
   `lintian` quiet, and make sure `debian/copyright` is complete and
   accurate. FTP-masters review this closely: the dual license and the
   bundled-engine licenses must all be listed.

3. **Note the embedded code copies.** Debian discourages bundled library
   copies (Debian Policy §4.13). Southstar *forks* lexbor, QuickJS,
   and WAMR in-tree and modifies them for tight integration, so they
   cannot simply be swapped for system packages. Expect the sponsor and
   FTP-masters to ask about this: explain the reasoning, keep the
   `debian/copyright` accounting exhaustive, and expect the forks to be
   recorded in the security tracker's embedded-code-copies list.

4. **Upload via the sponsor.** A DD signs and uploads to the archive;
   after NEW-queue review the package enters `unstable` in `main`,
   migrates to `testing`, and is mirrored by Debian.

`debian/watch` lets `uscan` track upstream GitHub tags so the sponsor
can spot new releases.

## Updating the package

For both paths the per-release flow is:

1. Tag the upstream release and update `version:` in `meson.build`.
2. Add a top entry to `debian/changelog`
   (`dch -v <version>-1 "New upstream release"`); set the distribution
   (`unstable` for Debian, or your repo's codename).
3. Rebuild with `dpkg-buildpackage`/`sbuild`.
4. For Path 1, add the new `.deb` to the `aptly` repo and re-publish; for
   Path 2, hand the new source package to the sponsor.

## Troubleshooting

* **`dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: ... not found`** — a runtime library's
  `-dev` package is missing from `Build-Depends`; add it and rebuild in a
  clean chroot to catch the rest.
* **`lintian: license-problem-*`** on an engine under `src/` or
  `subprojects/` — a bundled component's license is misdeclared; fix
  `debian/copyright` to match `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`.
* **Sandbox warnings at runtime** (`seccomp: load failed`) — harmless
  outside a confined environment; the per-tab Landlock + seccomp sandbox
  logs and continues if the host policy blocks it. See `tab-isolation.md`.
