# Southstar on openSUSE — packaging and distribution

This document records how Southstar is packaged for openSUSE through
the [Open Build Service (OBS)](https://build.opensuse.org), where it can
live, and how the git-backed build is wired up. For plain
build-from-source instructions (any distro) see `Linux.md`; this document
is specifically about the openSUSE RPM and OBS.

The build recipe lives at the repository **root** (`southstar.spec`),
because OBS clones the whole repo and looks for the recipe at the top of
the synced tree. Notes for maintainers are in `packaging/obs/README.md`.

## Install it (users)

Southstar is built in the OBS home project
[`home:andreasrosdal`](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:andreasrosdal/Southstar).
Add the repository and install; updates then arrive through `zypper`:

```sh
# openSUSE Tumbleweed
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/andreasrosdal/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:andreasrosdal.repo
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install southstar
```

For Leap, replace `openSUSE_Tumbleweed` with your release (e.g. `16.0`).
The package builds for `x86_64`, `aarch64`, and `i586`.

Prefer a one-off install without adding the repo? Grab the nightly RPM
`southstar-opensuse-x86_64.rpm` from a nightly server (see
[Nightly.md](Nightly.md); rebuilt from `main` each night;
`sudo zypper install ./…rpm`).

## Read this first: licensing

Southstar is **dual-licensed**: each recipient may take it under
**either** the **Nordstjernen Source License v1.0 (NSL-1.0)** **or** the
**GNU General Public License version 3 or later (GPL-3.0-or-later)**, at
their option. The spec declares this as `License: LicenseRef-NSL-1.0 OR GPL-3.0-or-later`.

openSUSE:Factory (Tumbleweed's main / OSS distribution) only accepts free
/ OSI-approved licenses, checked by its automated
[Cavil](https://github.com/openSUSE/cavil) legal scan and the legal team.
NSL-1.0 on its own would not pass — its **"Competing Use"** restriction
and its limit of education and research use to **non-commercial**
contexts make it non-free — but the GPL is free and OSI-approved, and
the package can be distributed under that option. The bundled third-party
code (see `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`) keeps its own free, GPL-3-compatible
licenses. **Southstar is therefore eligible for Factory**, subject to
the usual review.

There are two paths, in order of effort:

1. **The OBS home project (fully under our control).** We build and
   publish RPMs; users add the repo and `zypper install`. No Factory
   review. This is what the install section above uses, and it stays
   available whatever happens in Factory.
2. **openSUSE:Factory (the OSS distribution).** Possible through the
   GPL option. The package goes into a devel project and from there,
   by submit request, to `openSUSE:Factory`, where the devel project
   maintainers, the legal team (Cavil) and the Factory reviewers check
   it. Expect the legal review to look at the `LicenseRef-NSL-1.0` half
   of the expression, since it is not an SPDX-listed license; the
   `GPL-3.0-or-later` alternative is what qualifies the package. **Ask first**
   on the opensuse-factory mailing list which devel project should host
   it before preparing a submit request.

The non-OSS component (`openSUSE:Factory:NonFree` → the `non-oss` repo) is
no longer the target: it is for software without a free license option.

## Git-backed OBS package (scmsync)

The package is bound to this git repo with the OBS
[`obs-scm-bridge`](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-scm-bridge): OBS clones
`main` and builds it. Nothing is uploaded to OBS by hand and no source
tarball is stored — git is authoritative.

It is set via the package meta (package → *Advanced* → *Meta* in the web
UI, or `osc meta pkg home:andreasrosdal Southstar -e`), adding one line:

```xml
<scmsync>https://github.com/nordstjernen-web/southstar-browser?trackingbranch=main</scmsync>
```

After this, edit the spec in this repo and push — do not edit files in
OBS. To pick up a push, the bridge must re-fetch: re-save the meta, or set
up a `runservice` token as a GitHub push webhook so it re-syncs
automatically.

### Why there is no fetch `_service`

build.opensuse.org runs its build workers in **secure mode with no network
access**, so source services that clone over the network (`tar_scm`,
`obs_scm`) produce nothing there — the build dies at `recompress`
("no such file … `southstar-*.tar`") or at the buildtime `tar`
("no .obsinfo file found"). The scmsync bridge clones git on OBS
infrastructure *outside* the workers, which is why it is the only
git-backed path that works. The spec therefore has **no** `Source0` and no
`_service`; its `%prep` simply locates the source the bridge laid down and
assembles the build tree:

```spec
%prep
%setup -q -c -T
top=$(find "%{_sourcedir}" -name meson.build 2>/dev/null \
      | awk '{ print length, $0 }' | sort -n | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)
cp -a "$(dirname "$top")"/. .
test -f meson.build
```

## Build options and dependencies

The spec configures meson with two features off:

    -Dwebgpu=disabled   # needs external wgpu-native, not packaged
    -Dns-pango=disabled # OBS workers have no network to clone the subproject

On 32-bit x86 the bundled WebAssembly interpreter (WAMR, `src/wamr/`) fails
to build, so the spec additionally passes `-Dwasm=disabled` there:

```spec
%ifarch i386 i486 i586 i686
%global extra_meson -Dwasm=disabled
%endif
```

Everything else builds from the declared `BuildRequires`:

    gcc gcc-c++ meson ninja pkgconfig update-desktop-files
    pkgconfig(gtk4) pkgconfig(epoxy) pkgconfig(libcurl) pkgconfig(libcrypto)
    pkgconfig(uchardet) pkgconfig(libpsl) pkgconfig(sqlite3)
    pkgconfig(libwebp) pkgconfig(libavif) pkgconfig(sdl2)
    pkgconfig(libavcodec) pkgconfig(libavformat) pkgconfig(libavutil)
    pkgconfig(libswresample) pkgconfig(libswscale)
    pkgconfig(fontconfig) pkgconfig(pango) pkgconfig(pangocairo)
    pkgconfig(pangoft2)
    pkgconfig(libseccomp) pkgconfig(enchant-2)

The FFmpeg `libav*` packages are required, not optional: meson fails without
them on Linux, and they carry inline WebM (VP9/VP8 + Opus/Vorbis). The Pango
packages cover the system-Pango path that `-Dns-pango=disabled` selects.

The in-tree engines (lexbor, QuickJS, WAMR) and vendored single-file
libraries (Wuffs, pl_mpeg) build via meson `subdir()` / wraps — no `cmake`,
no system copies. `mpv` and `myspell-en_US` are `Recommends` (external
media playback and a spell-check dictionary).

The package is tagged `License: LicenseRef-NSL-1.0 OR GPL-3.0-or-later`;
`License.md` and `COPYING` (the GPL version 3 text) are shipped as `%license`.

## Local RPM build

Off OBS, you can build the same RPM from a checkout with `rpmbuild`, or use
the helper scripts `scripts/pack-rpm.sh` (portable repackage) and
`scripts/pack-srpm.sh` (source RPM). For OBS itself nothing is needed
beyond the `<scmsync>` meta line — pushing to `main` is the build trigger.

## Build the package set wider

Add more targets in the project's **Repositories** tab: openSUSE
Tumbleweed and Leap 16.0 are known good. Skip Debian targets (they expect
`debian/` packaging, not an RPM spec) and only keep the architectures you
care about.

## Troubleshooting

* **Build keeps using an old commit** — the bridge has not re-fetched.
  Re-save the package meta or trigger the `runservice` token; set up a
  GitHub push webhook so it syncs automatically.
* **`%prep` fails / meson can't find `meson.build`** — the bridge laid the
  source out somewhere the `%prep` search did not reach; check the
  `%{_sourcedir}` listing in the log.
* **`recompress` / buildtime `tar` errors about a missing tarball or
  `.obsinfo`** — a network fetch `_service` crept back in; remove it, the
  scmsync bridge provides the source.
* **i586 fails compiling `src/wamr/…`** — `-Dwasm=disabled` is not being
  applied for that arch; confirm the `%ifarch` block is present.
* **Sandbox warnings at runtime** (`seccomp: load failed`) — harmless
  outside a confined environment; the per-tab Landlock + seccomp sandbox
  logs and continues. See `tab-isolation.md`.
