# Third-party software notices

Southstar links to (and in some cases statically includes) the
following open-source libraries. One of them, ns-pango, is a **modified**
LGPL library; its source and our relink offer are described in its entry
below. Their copyright notices and license
texts are reproduced below. For libraries shipped dynamically in the
release bundles, you are entitled by the LGPL terms to replace them
with modified versions; the binary will continue to function with any
ABI-compatible replacement.

The Southstar source code itself is dual-licensed under the
Nordstjernen Source License v1.0 or the GNU General Public License
version 3 or later, at your option. See `License.md` and `COPYING` for the
project's own license terms.

### ns-pango — GNU LGPL 2.1 or later (modified Pango, statically linked)

> Text itemization, shaping and line breaking, with a cache of shaped runs
> that Pango itself does not keep.
> <https://github.com/nordstjernen-web/ns-pango>
>
> Copyright the GNU Project and contributors, and Northstar contributors
> for the modifications.

**This is a modified copy of Pango.** It adds a process-wide cache of
shaped glyph strings and of context font metrics, renames every exported
symbol so it can share a process with the system Pango that GTK loads, and
removes the backends and tooling a browser does not use. It remains
licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or, at
your option, any later version, and its complete corresponding source --
including every modification -- is published at the URL above. The full
license text is available at:

  <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>

Unlike the other LGPL libraries listed here, ns-pango is linked
**statically** into the Southstar executables. Per
LGPL section 6(a), you are entitled to modify ns-pango and relink
Southstar against your modified copy: write to the address in
`README.md` and we will supply the Southstar object files, together with
any data and utility programs needed, so that you can produce a modified
executable. Builds configured with `-Dns-pango=disabled` do not include
ns-pango; they link the system Pango dynamically instead.

These libraries are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 2.1, or (at your option) any later version. The full
license text is available at:

  <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>

Per LGPL section 6, since Southstar links to these libraries
dynamically, you are entitled to modify them and re-link Southstar
against the modified copies. On Windows / macOS bundles the libraries
are shipped alongside the executable as ordinary DLLs / dylibs that you
can replace; on Linux distributions they are loaded from the system
package manager.

### FFmpeg — libavformat / libavcodec / libavutil / libswscale / libswresample — GNU LGPL 2.1 or later (inline WebM)

> Container demuxing and audio/video decoding for the inline WebM path
> (VP9/VP8 video, Opus/Vorbis audio). <https://ffmpeg.org>
>
> Copyright the FFmpeg developers.

Required on Linux and Windows and auto-detected on macOS, so it is present
in every build with WebM support. The copy
bundled in the macOS / Windows releases is built **LGPL-only** — its
`configure` uses `--disable-gpl --disable-nonfree --disable-version3
--disable-autodetect`, so it contains no GPL components and no external
codec libraries; the enabled VP8/VP9/Opus/Vorbis decoders are FFmpeg's
own LGPL implementations (see `scripts/build-ffmpeg-lgpl.sh`). The full
license text is available at:

  <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>

Per LGPL section 6, the libraries are linked dynamically: on the
macOS / Windows bundles they ship beside the executable as ordinary
dylibs / DLLs you can replace and re-link against; on Linux they are
loaded from the distribution's FFmpeg packages.

### Cairo — LGPL-2.1 or MPL-1.1

> 2D drawing.
> <https://www.cairographics.org>

> Copyright Carl Worth, Behdad Esfahbod, and the Cairo contributors.

Mozilla Public License 1.1. See:

### librsvg — GNU LGPL 2.1 or later (Windows / macOS bundles)

> Not used by the browser: SVG is rendered in-engine by `src/svg.c`.
> librsvg reaches the Windows and macOS bundles only as a transitive
> dependency of the gdk-pixbuf loader directory and of GTK's symbolic
> icon loading, so its notice is reproduced here for redistribution.
> <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg>

> Copyright the GNU Project and contributors.

Licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or
later. See the LGPL section above for terms and obligations.

### Optional dynamic dependencies

These are linked only when present on the build host (meson
`required: false`). When a build bundles them, their notices apply:

- **Brotli** (`libbrotlidec`) — MIT, © the Brotli authors. `br`
  HTTP content decoding.
- **Zstandard** (`libzstd`) — BSD 3-Clause or GNU GPL 2.0, at your
  option, © Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates. `zstd` HTTP content
  decoding.
- **libavif** — BSD 2-Clause, © the AOMedia / libavif authors. AVIF
  image decoding.
- **Poppler** (`poppler-glib`) — GNU GPL 2.0 or later, © the Poppler
  developers. PDF rendering. Note: Poppler is GPL; a build that links it
  is subject to the GPL for that combined binary.
- **Fontconfig** — MIT-style license, © Keith Packard and contributors.
- **FreeType** — FreeType License (BSD-style with credit clause) or GNU
  GPL 2.0, at your option, © The FreeType Project.
- **wgpu-native** — MIT or Apache 2.0, © the gfx-rs authors. The
  experimental WebGPU backend. Its two C headers are vendored under
  `third_party/wgpu-native/include/webgpu/`: `webgpu.h` is BSD 3-Clause,
  © 2019-2023 the WebGPU-Native developers; `wgpu.h` carries
  wgpu-native's own MIT-or-Apache-2.0 terms. The library itself is never
  vendored — it is located at build time and, in the release bundles,
  ships beside the executable.
- **QuickJS** (the original engine) — MIT, © 2017-2021 Fabrice Bellard
  and Charlie Gordon. <https://github.com/bellard/quickjs>. Linked
  statically, in place of the quickjs-ng fork, only into builds
  configured with `-Dquickjs=quickjs`; it is fetched at configure time
  through `subprojects/quickjs.wrap` and never vendored, with one local
  patch, `subprojects/packagefiles/quickjs-sort-calls-comparator.patch`,
  so `Array.prototype.sort` calls its comparator for identical values. Its
  license text is the MIT text in the quickjs-ng section above.
